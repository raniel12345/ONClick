## What I learn

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) - is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
- [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/learn/) - GraphQL is a query language for your API, and a server-side runtime for executing queries by using a type system you define for your data. GraphQL isn't tied to any specific database or storage engine and is instead backed by your existing code and data.
- [Apollo Server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/) - is the best way to quickly build a production-ready, self-documenting API for GraphQL clients, using data from any source.
- [Sequelize](https://sequelize.org/) - Sequelize is a promise-based Node.js ORM for Postgres, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite and Microsoft SQL Server. It features solid transaction support, relations, eager and lazy loading, read replication and more.
- [PostgresSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) - is a powerful, open source object-relational database system with over 30 years of active development that has earned it a strong reputation for reliability, feature robustness, and performance.
- [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) - is a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.
